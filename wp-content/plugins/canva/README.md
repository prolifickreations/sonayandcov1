## Installation - To be completed ...
If you are reading this file, you most likely have downloaded a zip file from Canva or the wordpress plugin repository.

To install simply unzip the folder into your wordpress wp-content/plugins directory and then in the wp-admin -> plugins menu
find the "Canva" entry and click the activate link.

If this is unfamiliar, we suggest you use [this helpful guide from wpbeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/) to help you through your install.

If you see the "canva settings" menu with the canva 'C' as it's menu icon, the plugin has installed correctly.
